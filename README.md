Objective:-
"The objective of this project is to analyze movie sales data by reverse engineering the existing database schema and utilizing SQL queries to derive actionable insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and product trends.

Scope:-
"This project involves reverse engineering the database schema to reconstruct the database design and then using SQL queries to analyze sales data, customer behavior, and movie performance.

Definition:-
"Reverse engineering involves analyzing an existing database to reconstruct its schema, including tables, relationships, and constraints, to understand and document its structure.

Tools Used:-
MySQL Workbench: For reverse engineering the database schema and creating Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram.

Methodology:-
Database Extraction: Connected to the existing movie sales database using MySQL Workbench and extracted the schema using the 'Reverse Engineer' feature, which generated an initial ER diagram.

Schema Analysis: Analyzed the extracted schema to identify tables, columns, relationships, and constraints. This included understanding primary and foreign key relationships.

ER Diagram Creation: Created an ER diagram to visually represent entities and their relationships. Refined the diagram based on schema analysis to ensure accuracy.

Validation: Validated the reconstructed schema against sample data and queries to ensure that it accurately reflects the underlying data structure.
